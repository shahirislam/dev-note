# **App Name**: DevFlow

## Core Features:

- Project List: Display active projects in a list format on the home dashboard.
- Today's Tasks: Show a concise list of tasks due for the current day.
- Project Details Page: Display project title, notes section, and task list with progress.
- AI-Powered Note Generation: Rich text editor powered by generative AI to help generate, edit, or summarize notes based on context. An AI tool decides whether to include particular notes in a generated output.
- Data Export: Enable users to export all projects, tasks, and notes as a single JSON file for backup and migration. Projects optionally show % progress (tasks done vs total).
- Data Import: Allow importing project data from a JSON file. The structure of this JSON file should match the structure used by the Export Data feature.
- Theme Switcher: Implement a toggle switch to switch between a light and dark color scheme.

## Style Guidelines:

- Light theme: Background color is #F5F5F5.
- Dark theme: Background color is #121212.
- Primary color: Use blue (#2196F3) for accents and interactive elements. The selected blue gives a modern, technological vibe.
- Accent color: Green (#30BF33), to complement the primary hue and signal 'go.'
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for a modern, clean UI.
- Use Material Design icons to maintain consistency with Material 3 principles.
- Employ rounded cards and buttons following Material You, with subtle shadows for a layered effect.
- Incorporate gentle transitions and animations for creating and modifying tasks/notes, with feedback to indicate the outcome of these interactions.
